I’m a **machine learning researcher** with broad interests in statistics, neuroscience, and cognitive science — and a strong bias toward building things that work in the real world.

I completed my PhD at **ETH Zurich**, where I worked at the intersection of **continual learning**, **Bayesian deep learning**, and **computational neuroscience**. My research aimed to understand how neural systems can learn adaptively and robustly over time, and how those principles might be translated into machine learning systems.

Since 2022, I’ve been with **EthonAI**, a Zurich-based startup building AI tools for industrial applications. As the first employee, I led the development of our flagship **computer vision product** for visual quality inspection — from early prototyping to global deployment. As product owner, I shaped the roadmap through direct collaboration with users, gaining hands-on experience in building reliable, production-grade software. Today, I lead our **R&D team**, driving the development of next-generation industrial AI systems.

Outside of work, I’m often traveling or in mountains — hiking, climbing, or skiing. I also enjoy bouldering, dancing, and the occasional deep-dive into random topics.

This website is still a work in progress, but I plan to use it to share **blog posts**, thoughts, and experiments on machine learning and beyond — stay tuned!
