## Privacy Policy

This website is operated by Christian Henning. Your privacy is important to me.

- How long you stay on each page
- The type of device or browser you use
- Your approximate location (city or country)

Google processes this data in accordance with its [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). IP anonymization is enabled, meaning your IP address is shortened before being stored by Google.
